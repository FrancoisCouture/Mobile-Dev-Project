This is the guide I obtained from brightspace. If you did some work, put a number that best relates in the summary with your name, and push it to
github. Feel free to use the description for whatever. (Francois)

1. Create the word bank
	- a spaced inserted after a selected word
	- all words should be visible at the same time

2. Implement keyboard functionality for everything including the grey keys.
	- each key is 50px
	- 25px spacing between keys
	- key font size is double default
	- keyboard width can't go beyond 725px
	- implement full keyboard functionality (symbols etc)
	- key should double in size when hovered on
	- shift key and caps-lock both present
	- once key is pressed, shift should be de-activated

3. Implement the save/cancel/undo functionality.
	- this is in the text box area aswell

4. Once the others are done, each blog should save to the server.
	- the publish button should not work if the
	  server isn't working
